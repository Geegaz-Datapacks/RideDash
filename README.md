**Note on python virtual environments:** created with `py -m venv .venv` (from the VSCode Docs: [Python - Environments](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_create-a-virtual-environment-in-the-terminal)), the interpreter is selected automatically and terminals created after that use the virtual environment automatically. Once created, it's possible to use `pip` and `beet` commands in the terminal as usual, just remember to run `pip install beet`
