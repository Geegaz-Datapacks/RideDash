### About python virtual environments 
Created with `py -m venv .venv` (from the VSCode Docs: [Python - Environments](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_create-a-virtual-environment-in-the-terminal)), the interpreter is selected automatically if you have the Python extension enabled. Creating a new terminal after that will activate the virtual environment, making it possible to use `pip` and `beet` commands in the terminal as usual. Just remember to run `pip install beet` after creating the virtual environment !
